<p><a name="_Ref401072659">5. SERVICES</a></p>

<p>5.1 As further described below, the "<b>Services</b>" which we provide through the App will allow you to make calls to conventional telephone numbers around the world (subject to your contact being in an area or jurisdiction which we at the time supports) which you have saved in the address book of your Device. In more detail, the Services enable you to place voice calls over the <i>public switched telephone network</i>, terminating on both fixed and mobile telephony networks. We can offer termination in several countries around the world, but we can’t guarantee that we support termination in all countries or to all phone numbers or that we always will support termination to any particular country or phone number. The calls are enabled through usage of <i>application programming interface</i> in the App, communicating with RebTel’s back-end infrastructure, meaning among other things that certain parts of the call will be routed over the Internet. We make no representation that our Services are available for use in any particular location.</p>

<p>5.2 We reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to our Service at any time without notice. In no event will we be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to our Service. We may also impose limits on the use of or access to our Service without notice or liability.</p>

<p>5.3 You acknowledge and understand that the Services provided by us are not a traditional mobile or fixed line telephone service or a replacement for your primary telephone service.</p>

<p>5.4 In order to use the Services, you must have data connectivity services from your service provider, which may be your mobile carrier, WiFi service provider or other provider (the “<b>Mobile Operator(s)</b>”). The cost of this data connectivity service may vary among Mobile Operators and you understand that it is your responsibility to check and pay for such costs. Note that some Mobile Operators prohibit or restrict the use of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) functionality, and may also impose additional fees in connection with VoIP functionality. You are solely responsible for verifying with your Mobile Operator or other service providers that your use of the Services is permitted in accordance with any contractual obligations you may have with that third party.</p>

<p>5.5 Note - Out-of-country usage may lead to significantly higher costs than regular usage, and you are solely responsible for keeping yourself informed and paying for possible roaming and other applicable charges levied by your Mobile Operator(s).</p>

<p>5.6 To the extent you choose to access our Services, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws.</p>

<p>6. Payment etc.</p>

<p>6.1 The Services are provided by Rebtel on a pre-paid basis, more specifically, to be able to make a call through the App to a phone number in a specific country you must first purchase a bundle of minutes worth of calling time to that specific country (“<b>Call Time Pack</b>”). For example, if you buy a bundle of <i>10 minutes</i> to Australia you will be able to make one or several call(s) to one or several person(s) in Australia and talk for a total of 10 minutes (not taking into consideration any effects of the minute rounding off regime set forth in section 6.5 below).</p>

<p>6.2 Call Time Packs to the various destination countries are purchased within the App (an "<b>in-App Purchase</b>") as set forth in section 6.3 below. The prices for the available Call Time Packs (including VAT where applicable) are displayed in the App. The prices for the Call Time Packs are subject to change without notice to you. The new prices will apply to your next purchase of a Call Time Pack after the new prices have been published.</p>

<p>6.3 All in-App Purchases shall be made through Apple. If you choose to make an in-App Purchase you agree: (i) that we may use the services of Apple to process transactions on our behalf; (ii) to review and be bound by Apple’s terms of use and privacy policy; (iii) to only provide valid and current information for yourself; and (iv) except as expressly set forth herein or in any applicable terms and conditions with Apple, that all purchases are final and non-refundable. You acknowledge that you may need to hold, or register, an active account with Apple in order to complete an in-App Purchase. We are not responsible or liable for any activities or conduct of Apple, and you agree to hold us harmless, and expressly release us, from any and all liability arising from the conduct of Apple.</p>

<p>6.4 If you have bought a Call Time Pack it will remain active for a period of thirty (30) days from your last use of the minutes pertaining to that specific Call Time Pack, at which time all of your unused minutes pertaining to that Call Time Pack will expire, unless applicable law requires that the minutes remain active for a longer period of time.</p>

<p>6.5 The measurement of call duration is based on one-minute increments, meaning that the duration of a call is rounded up to the next minute. For example, if you call for 7 minutes and 10 seconds we will round up your call to 8 minutes (hence; 8 minutes will be deducted from the available minutes in the applicable Call Time Pack).</p>

<p>6.6 Rebtel may collect VAT or other indirect taxes at the appropriate rate for the particular territory (as per applicable tax rules) at the time of purchase of a Call Time Pack.</p>

<p><a name="_Toc400955333"></a><a name="a681492">7. Intellectual property rights</a></p>

<p>7.1 You acknowledge that all intellectual property rights in the App and the Technology anywhere in the world belong to us or our licensors, that rights in the App are licensed (not sold) to you, and that you have no rights in, or to, the App or the Technology other than the right to use each of them in accordance with the terms of this EULA.</p>

We do not warrant against interference with your enjoyment of the Services or that the Services will be uninterrupted or error-free, or that defects in the Services will be corrected.

<p>11.3 You understand that if you delete the App, or if we terminate the EULA in accordance with section 11, you will lose any remaining minutes worth of calling time purchased but have not been used by the point of termination and we will not compensate you for this loss or make any refund to you.</p>
