   <h2>Common questions</h2>
   
   <h3>Q: How do I call a contact in my phone's address book?</h3>
   <p>
    A: From the main view in the app, first select the country you are calling to and then tap the name of the contact to initiate the call. If you are low on call time you will be prompted with the option to add time.
   </p>
   
   <h3>Q: Why is my phone contact not visible in the app?</h3>
   <p>
    A: Express Caller only displays numbers from your address book starting with international dialing prefixes, i.e. +46 for Sweden, +1 for USA etc. Make sure the contacts you want to call are saved in an international format in your phone's address book. Otherwise simply update them and restart the Experess caller app. 
   </p>   
   
   <h3>Q: Is Express Caller free to use?</h3>
   <p>
    A: The app is free to download. You need to buy calling time to your calling destination from inside the app.
