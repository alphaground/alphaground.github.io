   <h3>Q: Why is my phone contact not visible in the app?</h3>
   <p>
    A: Express caller only dispalys numbers from your address book starting with international dialing prefixes, i.e. +46 for Sweden, +1 for USA etc. Make sure the contacts you want to call are saved in an international format in your phone's address book. Otherwise simply update them and restart the Experess caller app.
